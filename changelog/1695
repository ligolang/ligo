description: '#### New operations `Test.save_context` and `Test.restore_context`\n\n-
  `Test.save_context : unit -> unit` : takes current testing framework context and
  saves it, pushing it into a stack of contexts.\n- `Test.restore_context : unit ->
  unit` : pops a testing framework context from the stack of contexts, and sets it
  up as the new current context. In case the stack was empty, the current context
  is kept.'
