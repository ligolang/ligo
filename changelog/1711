description: \n#### Deprecated constants\n\nIn previous versions of LIGO, warnings
  were emitted for deprecated constants (e.g. `balance`, `sender`, etc.). We finally
  remove those constants. Please consult API documentation in ligolang.org to find
  a new constant that can replace the old one in your contract.
