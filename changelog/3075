description: "\\n\`ligo compile contract\` now infers the compilation target when the top-level is not a contract and defines only one contract module. In this case, the module becomes the compilation target (to avoid usage of `-m`).\\n\\nThis following contract\\n\\n\\n```ocaml\\n(* myfile.mligo *)\\nmodule Single = struct\\n  [@entry] let main () () : operation list * unit = [],()\\nend\\n\\n```\\n\\ncan now be compiler using \`ligo compile contract myfile.mligo\`\\n\\n"
