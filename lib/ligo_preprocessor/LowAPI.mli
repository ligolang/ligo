(* The low-level API of the preprocessor

  This preprocessor recognises the following directives:

  "#define", "#elif", "#else", "#endif", "#error", "#if", "#include"
  and "#undef".

   Those are derived from the C# preprocessor.

   Note that unknown directives will be treated like plain text
   instead of raising an error.

   Strings and comments are only recognised in text areas that are to
   be copied.

   Comments can be chosen from the following list:
      * "(*" and "*)" for blocks and "//" for lines;
      * "/*" and "*/" for blocks and "//" for lines;
      * "/*" and "*/" for blocks and "#" for lines;
   or any combination of the above. For other markers, you need to
   modify API.mll.

   In case of success, a buffer containing the preprocessed input is
   returned, together with the list of imported modules and their
   locations on the file system. In case of an error, we return the
   preprocessed buffer so far, if any, and an error message. *)
