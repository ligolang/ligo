(* The type [mode] defines the two scanning modes of the preprocessor:
   either we copy the current characters or we skip them. *)

type mode = Copy | Skip

(* Trace of directives. We keep track of directives #if, #elif, and #else *)

type cond  = If of mode | Elif of mode | Else
type trace = cond list

(* The type [state] groups the information that needs to be
   threaded along the scanning functions:

     * the field [env] records the symbols defined by #define and not
       undefined by #undef;

     * the field [mode] informs whether the preprocessor is in
       copying or skipping mode;

     * the field [trace] is a stack of previous, still active
       conditional directives in order to support the parsing of
       conditionals without resorting to a parser generator like
       [menhir];

     * the field [out] keeps the output buffer;

     * the field [chans] is a list of opened input channels (this is
       to keep track of embedded file inclusions by #include and close
       them when we are done and avoid a memory leak (channels are not
       collected by the OCaml collector));

     * the field [incl] is isomorphic to the file system path to
       the current input file, and it is changed to that of any
       included file;

     * the field [imports] is a list of (filename, module) imports
       (#import);

     * the field [parent] points to the parent file when processing
       nested #include;

     * the field [pos] records the current position in the input;

     * the field [set_pos] sets a new current position in the input,
       in order to support the processing of #include and the
       linemarkers it generates;

     * the field [sync] reads the lexing buffer after it has been
       matched by a regular expression in a scannning rule, and
       extracts the new state and a region packed with the scanned
       lexeme;

     * the field [newline] must be called on each newline character of
       the input. *)
