(* RULES *)

(* The rule [scan] scans the input buffer for directives, strings,
   comments, blanks, new lines and end of file characters. As a
   result, either the matched input is copied to the buffer or not,
   depending on the compilation directives. Even if not in copy mode,
   new line characters are output.

   Important note: Comments and strings are recognised both in
   copy and skip mode, as GNU GCC does. *)
