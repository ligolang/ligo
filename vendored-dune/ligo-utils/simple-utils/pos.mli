(* Positions in a file

   A position in a file denotes a single unit belonging to it, for
   example, in an ASCII text file, it is a particular character within
   that file (the unit is the byte in this instance, since in ASCII
   one character is encoded with one byte).

     Units can be either bytes (as ASCII characters) or, more
   generally, unicode points. *)

(* DEFINITION *)

(* The type for positions is the object type [t].

     We use here lexing positions to denote byte-oriented positions
   (field [byte]), and we manage code points by means of the fields
   [point_num] and [point_bol]. These two fields have a meaning
   similar to the fields [pos_cnum] and [pos_bol], respectively, from
   the standard module [Lexing]. That is to say, [point_num] holds the
   number of code points since the beginning of the file, and
   [point_bol] the number of code points since the beginning of the
   current line.

     * The name of the file is given by the field [file], and the
       line number by the field [line].

     * The call [pos#new_line s], where the string [s] is either
       ["\n"] or ["\c\r"], updates the position [pos] with a new
       line.

     * The call [pos#add_nl] assumes that the newline character is
       one byte.

     * The call [pos#shift_bytes n] evaluates in a position that is
       the translation of position [pos] of [n] bytes forward in the
       file.

     * The call [pos#shift_one_uchar n] is similar, except that it
       assumes that [n] is the number of bytes making up one unicode
       point.

     * The call [pos#offset `Byte] provides the horizontal offset of
       the position [pos] in bytes. (An offset is the number of
       units, like bytes, since the beginning of the current line.)
       The call [pos#offset `Point] is the offset counted in number
       of unicode points.

     * The calls to the method [column] are similar to those to
       [offset], except that they give the curren column number.

     * The call [pos#line_offset `Byte] is the offset of the line of
       position [pos], counted in bytes. Dually, [pos#line_offset
       `Point] counts the same offset in code points.

     * The call [pos#byte_offset] is the offset of the position
       [pos] since the begininng of the file, counted in bytes.
