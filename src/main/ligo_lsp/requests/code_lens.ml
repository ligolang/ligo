(** Lenses that suggest adding "TZIP-16 compliance" attribute to potential
    storages.

    Workflow around this feature is the following:

    We use heuristics to guess which variables are likely some storages that
    follow TZIP-16, this happens in `on_doc` and populates the cache. For these
    storages we supply a code lens that adds a special LIGO attribute indicating
    TZIP-16 compliance, allowing for the next stage. This is done by executing
    [Lsp_commands.add_tzip16_attr] command.

    Then all variables annotated as TZIP-16 compliant are checked, and results
    go to diagnostics as normal warnings.

    We require such manual confirmation in regards to which storages to check
    because:
    1. Some of them may require no checking (e.g. used in tests), and running
       checks is relatively costly (requires JSON downloads at least once per
       coding session).
    2. Some storages may be non-TZIP-16 compliant intentionally (for tests).
    3. The used heuristics to discover TZIP-16-formatted storages are not 100%
       accurate.
