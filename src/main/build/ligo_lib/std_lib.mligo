    The function `@and` is also defined when the left operand is of
    type `int`. Negative numbers are considered in two's complement
    representation, starting with a virtual infinite number of 1s.

    When `@and` is used for bytes operands, the bytes result has the

    operand is cut to match with the length of the shorter one before
    taking the bitwise "and". *)

    For bytes, the function `shift_left` consumes one byte sequence
    and one natural number, and produces the bytes logically
    left-shifted by the natural number. The vacated bits on the right
    are filled with zeros. The shifted bits are minimally zero-padded
    on the left in order to keep all the original bits, regardless if
    they are 0 or 1: for example, `shift_left 0x1234 1` is `0x002468`,

    would be lost) or `0x00002468` (where padding is not minimal). The
    length of the bytes returned by `shift_left` is `l + (s + 7) / 8`

    natural number. This instruction is only defined if the second

    For bytes, the function `shift_right` consumes one chunk of bytes

    minimally zero-padded on the left. For example, `shift_right

    bits are lost) or `0x000091` (not minimal padding). The length of
    the returned bytes by `shift_right` is `max 0 (l - s / 8)` bytes,
