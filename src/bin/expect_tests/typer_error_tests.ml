  Here we have a tuple nested inside another
  The diff should suggest a [REPLACE subtuple_a BY subtuple_b]

  For example :
    int * string * (nat * tez * nat) *          tez
  vs.
    int *          (nat * tez * int) * string * tez * address
          ^^^^^^                ^^^
  Here, we suppose the probable desired diff is :
    DELETE string
    CHANGE (nat * tez * nat) TO (nat * tez * int) (TODO NP : Ideally have diff of subtuples somehow)
    ADD    string
    keep   tez
    ADD    address
  But if all changes were considered equal, we would have :
    CHANGE string            TO (nat * tez * int)
    CHANGE (nat * tez * nat) TO string
    keep   tez
    ADD    address

  But weights are computed accordingly to the size of the types involved,
  so the first diff should be chosen over the second.
  In the first diff,
    weight DELETE string = 1
    weight CHANGE (nat * tez * nat) TO (nat * tez * int) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
    weight ADD string = 1
    total weight = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
  In the second diff, however
    weight CHANGE string            TO (nat * tez * int) = 3
    weight CHANGE (nat * tez * nat) TO string = 3
    total weight = 3 + 3 = 6

  Because both subtuples are similar, the weight to change subtuple_a
  into subtuple_b is low (it's 0 + 0 + 1 = 1), so this diff is prefered.

(*
  In this case, the tuple is itself composed of several
  long sub-tuples.

  Since [s] and [s_close] are similar types,
  the weight to change one into another
  should be less than to change [s] to [s1] or [s2] or [s3] etc.
  So the diff should "match" [s] and [s_close] together,
  in a [REPLACE s BY s_close]

  TODO : Ideally we would like to get a more precise
         diff of the subtuples themselves.
