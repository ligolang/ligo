(*
  This test suite stressed the disabling of coloring on CLI output.

  It can be done through the [--no-color] CLI option,
  or via setting the NO_COLOR environment variable.
  This choice is in accordance to the [no-color.org] standard.

  Disabling the coloring is done through disabling ANSI codes
  (for bold and colorful text) in CLI output.
