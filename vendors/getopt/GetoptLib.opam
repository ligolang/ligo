synopsis     : "An implementation of GNU getopt for OCaml projects"
description  : "The OCaml distribution comes with the module Arg specialized in
command-line parsing. However, it doesn't support the well known
features of GNU getopt and getopt_long. The module Getopt is an alternative; it supports GNU syntax, but from the programmer point of view, it is close to the spirit of Arg: the programmer gives to the general parsing function a list of possible options, together with the behaviour of these options."
