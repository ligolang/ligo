### :white_check_mark: Checklist for the LIGO Language Server

- I checked whether I need to update the `README.md` file for the [plugin](/tools/vscode/README.md) and did so if necessary:
    - [ ] If I implemented a new LSP request, I added it to the list of supported features that may be disabled
    - [ ] If I implemented a new LSP method, I added it to the list of supported functionality
- [ ] I checked that my changes work in Emacs, Vim, and Visual Studio Code
- [ ] (Before merging) The commit history is squashed and prettified, and follows the [Serokell commit policy](https://www.notion.so/serokell/Commit-and-PR-policy-4cf98e1a910a415d86b5f2491d9af1af), or the MR is set to squash the commits
