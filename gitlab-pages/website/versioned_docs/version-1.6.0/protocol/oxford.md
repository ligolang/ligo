## Description

Oxford does not bring any particular feature reflected directly on LIGO, but the compiler still manages every Tezos protocol, and contracts for Oxford can be compiled.

With Oxford 2, the function `Test.stake` now results in an error when called, as by default the testing mode uses auto staking.
