LIGO is a programming language that aims to provide developers with an uncomplicated and safe way to implement smart contracts. Since it is being implemented for the Tezos blockchain LIGO compiles to Michelsonâ€”the native smart contract language of Tezos.

> Smart contracts are programs that run within a blockchain network.

LIGO was meant to be a language for developing Marigold on top of a hacky framework called Meta-Michelson. However, due to the attention received by the Tezos community, LIGO is now a standalone language being developed to support Tezos directly.
