### SYNOPSIS
```
ligo print mini-c SOURCE_FILE
```

### DESCRIPTION
This sub-command prints the source file in the Mini-C stage. Internally, it uses the build system to type and compile the contract. Compilation is applied after combination in the AST typed stage.

### FLAGS
**--display-format FORMAT**
the format that will be used by the CLI. Available formats are 'dev', 'json', and 'human-readable' (default). When human-readable lacks details (we are still tweaking it), please contact us and use another format in the meanwhile. (alias: --format)

**--optimize ENTRY_POINT**
Apply Mini-C optimizations as if compiling ENTRY_POINT

**--project-root PATH**
The path to root of the project.

**--skip-analytics**
Avoid ligo analytics publication. Configurable with environment variable LIGO_SKIP_ANALYTICS too

**--syntax SYNTAX**
the syntax that will be used. Currently supported syntaxes are "cameligo" and "jsligo". By default, the syntax is guessed from the extension (.mligo and .jsligo respectively). (alias: -s)

**--warn-infinite-loop**
warn about infinite loop

**--warn-unused-rec**
warn about unused recursion in a recursive function

**-p PROTOCOL**
